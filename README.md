# Password-strength-checker
This Python-based Password Strength Checker evaluates passwords based on length, lowercase/uppercase letters, digits, and special characters. It provides a strength rating (Weak, Moderate, Strong) and estimates how long it would take to crack the password using brute-force methods, helping users improve their online security.
